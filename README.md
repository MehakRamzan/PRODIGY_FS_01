The User Authentication System is a web application designed to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for user registration, login, and authentication. Utilizing modern web development technologies, this project ensures robust security measures, efficient data handling, and an intuitive user experience.

Features
User Registration: Users can register by providing their name, email, and password. The system validates the password to ensure it meets security standards.
User Login: Registered users can log in using their email and password. The system verifies credentials against stored data.
Password Validation: Enforces strong password policies requiring a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
Session Management: Maintains user sessions to keep users logged in until they choose to log out.
Logout: Users can log out, which destroys their session and redirects them to the login page.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
Express.js: Web framework for handling routing and middleware.
Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB, managing data schema and operations.
EJS: Templating engine for rendering dynamic web pages.
HTML/CSS: Frontend design and layout.
MongoDB: Database for storing user data.

Project Description
This project was created to demonstrate the implementation of a secure user authentication system. Key tasks completed include setting up the server environment, integrating MongoDB with Mongoose, creating user registration and login functionalities, enforcing password validation rules, and managing user sessions. Additionally, a logout feature was implemented to allow users to end their sessions and redirect them to the login page.

Knowledge Gained
Through this project, valuable insights were gained into backend and frontend development, particularly in areas such as Express.js routing, session management, EJS templating, and MongoDB operations. The importance of user feedback, strong password policies, and error handling was also emphasized, contributing to a more secure and user-friendly application.
